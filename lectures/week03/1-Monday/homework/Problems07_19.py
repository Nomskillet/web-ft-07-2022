# 2. Implement a 'pluck' function. 
# Pluck should accept a list and a string representing a 
# property name and return a list containing that property from each object.

# example
paints = [{"color": 'red', "text-align": "right"}, {"color": 'blue', "margin": "0px"}, {"color": 'yellow', "padding": "5px"}]
# pluck(paints, 'color')
# returns =>>>>> ['red', 'blue', 'yellow']

    for i in range(len(list)):
        new_list.append(list[i][string])
