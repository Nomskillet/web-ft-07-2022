<H1>You can write your thoughts here</H1>
<H2>Or rant about whatever grinds your gears</H2>
<H3>Like that Jeremy guy, for example</H3>
<H4>I mean, like what is his deal?</H4>
<h5>Why does he drink so much Coke Zero? Weird...</h5>

<p>Here's what I like about lists:</p>
<ul>
    <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
    <li>That's about it</li>
    <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
</ul>

<ol>
    <li>Decide if it's an ordered list or not</li>
    <li>If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the ol tag</li>
        <ol>
        <li>Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other<li>
        </ol>
    <li>You've got this, I believe in you!</li>
</ol>

<div>
    <ul>
        <li>If you want to sound normal, just use a regular li tag here</li>
        <li><i>If you want to sound interesting, try the italics tag</i></li>
        <li><b>If you want to sound annoying, try the bold tag</b></li>
    </ul>
