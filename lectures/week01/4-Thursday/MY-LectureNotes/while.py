#1. Create a program that will print from 1-10 using a while loop.

# count = 0
# while count < 10:
#   count += 1
#   print(count)

#2. Create a program that will print from 10-1 using a while loop.


# count = 10
# while count > 0:
#     count -= 1
#     print(count)

# #3. Create a program that prompts the user to enter a word.  The program doesn't stop asking the user to enter a word until the user enters the word "stop"



# # answer = (input("what is the magic word"))
    
# #      if answer == stop:
# #     print("done")
    
# #     else:
# #         print("try again")
    
    

# #4a. Create a program that has a variable named username and another variabled named password with values of your choice.

# username = "Bob"
# password = "Tom"
# attempted_username = ""
# attempted_password = ""
# attempts = 0
# #4b. Prompt the user for a username and then a password.


# while attempted_username != username or attempted_password != password
#    attempted_username = input("Enter username)")
#    attempted_password = input("Enter password)")
# if username =="Tom":
#     print("Access Granted!")
# else:
#     print("Please try again?")
    
    

#4c. If the both match continue on with the program and give a welcome message.

#4d. If not it prompts the user for the username and password until they get it correct.

#4e. (bonus) have a limited amount of attempts and if they reach the limit it tells the user and exits the program.
